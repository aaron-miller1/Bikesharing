# Bikesharing

### Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to see if a bikesharing service such as Citibike could be beneficial in Des Moines, Iowa based off data from New York City, NY and provide an insight into whether or not would be profitable in a smaller city.


### Results

The results show that while Des Moines is smaller, a lot of users tend to be subscribers to the service, this leads us to believe that most use cases are used by individuals taking the bikes to their offices and the rest may use it to explore the city and go to tourist hotspots.


### Summary

The results show that a citibike service could be profitable in Des Moines; Even though the sample data is being pulled from a much larger city, it doesnt effect the outcome being that as long as their is an office environment mixed with tourist destinations, the citibike model will provide profit especially during peak commute hours of those who do not wish to drive or walk to or from work. Another couple of visualizations that could be performed are finding the average distance a bike travels and average distance per repair needs.
